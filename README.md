## What are we doing?

### The project ARPHAI

This project is one of the nine research grantees that are part of the inaugural cohort of [Global South AI4COVID Program][link_Global_South_AI4COVID], which is funded by [Canada's International Development Research Centre (IDRC)][link_IDRC] and the [Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA)][link_SIDA], with support from [Pulse Lab Jakarta][link_PulseLabJakarta] of the United Nations Global Pulse network.
The project seeks to lay the foundations for the incorporation of frontier technologies and techniques such as Artificial Intelligence and Data Science (AI&DS) in order to detect potential epidemic outbreaks early and favor preventive public health decision-making, based on evidence and with gender perspective, both at the national, sub-national and local levels. We start from the diagnosis that for this purpose it is mandatory to have quality digital data and generate the conditions for progressively the whole jurisdictions and provinces to implement an Electronic Health Record (EHR), in which the "primary data" resulting from the health service provided to users, which is essential to move towards a more effective and efficient public health system.

This project is a consortium of three institutions: [Centro Interdisciplinario de Estudios en Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación (CIECTI)][link_CIECTI] (the leader), [Ministerio de Salud de la Nación][link_Ministerio_Salud] and [Ministerio de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación de la Nación][link_MinCyT].

The multidisciplinary nature of the project requires the contributions of talented professionals from the most diverse areas. We are a big team that continues growing!

### The project ONBOARDING (in ARPHAI) 

In the framework of the ARPHAI project, we identified as a problem the difficulty in getting people and teams involved. Therefore, we identified the need to improve instruments that allow a faster and safer immersion in ARPHAI(MISSION), especially where research projects are closely related to sensitive data (tools currently being developed).  

The broader VISION of the proposal is to generate the conditions for improved openness and transparency that will encourage orderly participation in the project and thus enable its continuity in the medium term (irrespective of the source of funding and/or the people involved).


### Objectives

To this end, the proposal is to generate an ecosystem of instruments/devices to facilitate the entry and participation of teams and individuals in the project. For Example: defining the mechanisms for opening up the results, forms, and channels of communication, administrative issues, protocols for the presentation of work plans, mechanisms for articulation with other institutions, protocols for accessing data, etc. 


### Who are we?

The group that participates in the Onboarding (OLS) project is made up of:
